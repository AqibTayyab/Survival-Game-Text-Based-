# Survival Game (Text-Based) üèïÔ∏è

A simple text-based survival game written in C, where players must collect resources, manage hunger and thirst, and survive the wilderness. Random events, weather effects, and a crafting system add depth to the gameplay.

## Features
- **Resource Management**: Collect wood, food, and water to survive.
- **Hunger & Thirst System**: Keep your stats up to avoid health loss.
- **Random Events**: Encounter unexpected challenges or rewards.
- **Weather Effects**: Storms can prevent resource collection.
- **Crafting System**: Build a shelter for protection.
- **Game Balancing & Strategy**: Plan your actions wisely to survive as long as possible.

2. Compile the game using GCC:

## How to Play
- Choose actions each day to collect resources, build shelter, eat, drink, and survive.
